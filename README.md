##Description
Write an Angular client for the two-resource REST API that you built with Node and Express.
Previously
Create a two rest resource rest API with Express that's backed by Mongo. I'm leaving this pretty open to interpretation. I want you to write this from scratch, don't just copy and paste code from class or previous projects. Add a feature of Mongoose that we didn't use class, such as data validation. Also, implement a non CRUD resource (meaning doesn't use the full GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE interface).
